<h1>HONOR</h1>

<hr class="W10">

<p class="normal">The French expression, a &quot;man of the theater,&quot; is best exemplified in
the person of the German dramatist Hermann Sudermann. The term is
intended to convey the idea of a playwright who is interesting and
effective, one who is, in short, master of his trade. The author of
&quot;Die Ehre,&quot; which is here presented for the first time to English
readers, was for many years a man of the theater in the strictest
acceptance of the term.</p>

<p class="normal">Hermann Sudermann was born at Matziken, Prussia, in 1857. After
receiving his preliminary scholastic training in his native province,
he attended the Universities of Konigsberg and Berlin and immediately
after his graduation from the latter institution entered the field of
journalism. His first works were short stories and novels, of which
&quot;Dame Care,&quot; &quot;Regina,&quot; and &quot;The Song of Songs&quot; are the best known.
German critics and the German reading public are inclined, of late
years, in view of Sudermann's repeated failures in the field of drama,
to place his fiction on a distinctly higher plane than his plays, and
it is true that much of the finer intelligence of the man has gone to
the making of his better novels. However, the earlier plays exerted an
influence so widespread and are of such unquestioned intrinsic value,
that there is some question as to the ultimate disposition of the
laurels.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Honor&quot; was published in book form in 1888, the year before the
founding of the famous &quot;Freie Buhne,&quot; or &quot;Free Theater,&quot; which was to
usher in and nourish modern German Realism. It was first produced in
1890.</p>

<p class="normal">While Sudermann was not properly speaking a member of the new movement,
his early works, &quot;Honor&quot; in particular, were shaped by and served
partially to create the ideas which the founders of the &quot;Freie Buhne,&quot;
Arno Holz and Johannes Schlaf, had formulated. But a closer inspection
of &quot;Honor,&quot; of &quot;The Destruction of Sodom,&quot; &quot;Magda,&quot; and &quot;The Joy of
Living,&quot; leads us to the conclusion that Sudermann was playing with the
Naturalistic formula, using it as a means rather than an end. One
example will suffice: Arno Holz invented the phrase &quot;Sequential
Realism,&quot; by which he meant the chronological setting down of life in
as minute and truthful a manner as possible. He aimed at the
photographic reproduction of life; that process he called &quot;art
re-making nature.&quot; In his own plays, above all in &quot;Die Familie
Selicke,&quot; written in collaboration with Schlaf, his skill in noting
details, his quest for truth at all costs, lent a decided air of
actuality to the work, and the <i>appearance</i> was what Sudermann, who was
more of an artist than the pair of young revolutionists, strove to
imitate. After all, Sudermann is little more than a surface Realist,
for he incorporated only what seemed to him valuable in the new
formulas. Sudermann is the lineal descendant of Augier, Dumas fils and
Sardou; he introduced into Germany a new manner of combining much that
was good of the conventional and some that would prove beneficial of
the Realistic ideas. The long speeches of Trast, the numerous asides,
the more or less conventional exposition, the rather rhetorical style
of the dialog, are reminiscent of the mid-century French dramatists,
while the carefully observed types, the attention paid to detail, the
occasionally realistic language, are indicative of the new spirit which
was about to manifest itself in so concrete a form as the &quot;Freie
Buhne.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Honor&quot; is clearly a thesis play: it aims at the presentation and
consideration of an idea, a problem, and the problem is that which
arises when one's individual principles are at variance with those laid
down in a conventional society. In Germany &quot;honor&quot; is not so much a
personal matter as a fixed code applicable to situations, and an
individual who finds himself in a certain situation must have recourse
to the code, not his own convictions. Sudermann in this play sets
himself the task of opposing the current conception of honor, and in
Trast's mouth he places what arguments he wishes to have advanced.
Trast is what the French call the &quot;raisonneur&quot;: he who reasons. This
method is a very direct but rather bald one, as the audience is likely,
nowadays at least, to resent a preacher who is only too obviously doing
his duty. It prefers the method followed by another very skilful writer
of thesis plays, Brieux, who in his &quot;Red Robe&quot; allows the thesis to
unfold itself before the eyes of the spectators rather than permit a
&quot;raisonneur&quot; to expound his personal ideas. But in Sudermann's day the
technic of the drama was not so far advanced as it was twelve years
later, when the French dramatist was able to employ means to his end
which were artistic in the highest degree.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet Sudermann always lacked the sincerity and earnestness of Brieux,
for he considered the play primarily as a means to tell a story in as
effective a manner as possible. Brieux's purpose has always been to
expose a state of affairs and argue about it. As a consequence,
Sudermann never fell into the error of allowing the thesis to
overshadow the play. As a matter of fact, he became with years less and
less didactic, and took good care that his later plays should be free
of encumbering theses, so that now his desire to please the unthinking
public has brought him near to artistic bankruptcy.</p>

<p class="normal">Sudermann is clearly a man whose best work is over. &quot;Honor&quot; led
dramatists to treat the theater more seriously, it taught them to
construct plays with a story, and showed that a thesis play is not
necessarily a &quot;conversation&quot;; his attention to detail instilled a
desire for greater truthfulness in the delineation of character.
&quot;Honor&quot; and its immediate successors present a series of pictures of
lower, middle, and upper class German society of the day which are and
will in the future prove of great value for the student of the times
and of the drama.</p>

<h2>ACT I.</h2>
<br>

<p class="hang1"><span class="sc2">Scene</span>:--<i>A room in </i><span class="sc2">Heinecke's </span><i>
house--The cheap, lower middle-class
decorations and tawdry furnishings are in sharp contrast with two
silk-upholstered arm-chairs, which are covered during the first part of
the act--and a large gilded mirror. A chest of drawers and several
shelves are covered with various worn articles of household use. To the
right of the spectator, below the traditional German sofa, is a table
with a coffee service. To the left is a long, rough-hewn work-table;
upon it are pieces of cardboard, a pile of cardboard boxes and a large
paste-pot. Beside the table is a workstool.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="hang1">(<span class="sc2">Frau Heinecke </span><i>is busily engaged in cleaning the room</i>.
<span class="sc2">Frau Hebenstreit </span><i>stands on the threshold of the door to the left</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. So it's really true?--Your son is home?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Sh! sh!--for the Lord's sake--he's asleep!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. There is Alma's bedroom?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Yes!--I don't know what I'm about!--I'm actually dizzy
from joy! (<i>Drops into</i> the work-stool)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. Do the folks on the avenue know about it yet?<a name="div2Ref_01" href="#div2_01">[1]</a></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. He had to report to 'em to-day because they're his boss.
To-morrow he'll make the visit.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. How long has he been gone, anyway?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Seven--eight--nine and a half years. It's as long as
that since I've seen my boy! (<i>She sobs</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. And did you recognize him right off?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Well, how should I? Last night about eight--Heinecke was
half asleep over the Lokal Anzeiger.<a name="div2Ref_02" href="#div2_02">[2]</a> and I'm sitting there sewing a
lace hem on Alma's underwaist,--that girl's always got to have
something new for her underwear!--Well, all of a sudden there was a
knock, and a man come in, and Lord save us if there didn't stand a
gentleman, a fine gentleman in a beaver coat--there it hangs!--just
feel that beaverskin once!--I thought to myself: it's one of Alma's
swell acquaintances, one of young Herr Kurt's friends----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. (<i>Listening attentively</i>) Ah----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. For they ain't too stuck up to come around and see us
poor folks on the alley--Well, as I was saying, he throws his hat and
coat on the floor--a real top hat--right down on the floor, mind
you!--and he gets right down on his knees in front of me--well, I
thought I was losing my mind, but when he calls out; &quot;Mother, Father,
don't you know me?--It's me, Robert, your son Robert&quot;--Well, Frau
Hebenstreit, it was just too good to be true! I'll never get over it!
(<i>She cries</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. Don't get excited, neighbor; the pleasure won't last!
Every rat has a head and tail--and a rat's tail is poison, they do say.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. How can you say a thing like that! My son is a good son,
a fine son.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. Too fine, Frau Heinecke! When a person's been
traveling around in all them foreign lands and living in silks and
satins----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. He can have all that here--(<i>Indicating the silk
upholstered chairs</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. (<i>With a grimace</i>) Yes, yes,--but whether he will or
not----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Whether he will or not, Frau Hebenstreit! A mother's
heart don't reckon with rank and society!--And--Good Lord! Here
I am a-standing--Where on earth can Heinecke be? Have you seen
Heinecke?--The way he has to hobble along with his lame leg!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. I saw him standing outside with a sign as big as all
outdoors, drying his sign he said--and the thermometer at thirty above
zero!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Let the old man enjoy himself. He was working on that
sign half the night. Couldn't sleep a wink--neither of us--we was so
happy----</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc">Heinecke </span><i>enters, limping, with a huge placard. One of his arms is
stiff.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Hurrah! Now we've----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Will you be still!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Reading the placard</i>) &quot;Welcome, beloved son, to your
father's house.&quot; Fine, eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. Looks for all the world like a target!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. With a heart in the middle! You old--!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Hold your tongue!--(<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Frau Hebenstreit</span>) You know how
he is!</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Heinecke </span><i>takes a hammer and tacks and climbs on chair to tack up the
placard.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. I wonder where your son got all his fine manners
anyway? Not from <i>his</i> family, did he?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. No, nor mine either. It was seventeen years ago, when
our boss on the avenue got his title of Councillor of Commerce--there
was a great time: carriages and fireworkings and free beer for all the
workmen in the factory. Well, my husband was a little bit full--and why
not?--Pa, quit pounding! when it didn't cost nothing? Well, one of the
carriages run over him,--broke his leg and his arm!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Standing on the stool</i>) Talking about me? Yes, that wasn't
no joke, neither! (<i>Whistles</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Don't whistle! The folks in front can hear that from the
balcony, and they'll send round to find out what's the matter with our
family affairs!--And the boss was so tickled over his new title, that
he was feelin' free with his pocket-book and he promised to take care
of us and give our oldest an education.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. And did he stick to it?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Working</i>) Ah, there!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Couldn't 've done better! They gave us a place here on
the alley, where, thank God, we still are, and they sent Robert off to
the school where he got his learning. And when he came back home on his
vacations, he was always invited over on the avenue to drink chocolate
with whip-cream,--on purpose to play with the little Miss. Young Herr
Kurt was still sucking a rubber nipple then.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. That was all before Alma--?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>More quietly</i>) What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. Aw, nothing, I----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. And then afterwards they sent him to Hamburg to learn
about the foreign business, you know--and when he was seventeen off he
goes to India, where they say it's so outlandish hot! The Councillor's
nephew is out there. He's got a big coffee and tea plantation!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. It grows out there just like daisies do around here! (<i>Gets
down from the stool</i>) Fine, eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. And he got along pretty well out there, and, Lord, here
he is home again and I stand around and----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Hebenstreit</span>. I'm a-going. Good-bye, and don't forget the poison in
the rat's tail! (<i>Aside</i>) It's a pretty kettle of fish! (<i>She goes
out</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. She's an old poison-toad herself!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Jealousy--jealousy--jealousy!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Well! Where did you get the pound-cake!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. The cook brought it, with the compliments of the Miss.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Turning away</i>) What comes from the avenue don't interest
me! The boy must have had enough sleep by this time. The factory
whistle will blow for the second lunch<a name="div2Ref_03" href="#div2_03">[3]</a> in a minute! (<i>Looking
lovingly at the placard</i>) &quot;Welcome, beloved son----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Suddenly</i>) Father, he's here!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Who?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Our boy!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Pointing to placard</i>) We're ready for him!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Shh! I heard something! (<i>Listening</i>) Yes, I told you!
He's putting on his shoes. When I think of it! There he is a-sitting
putting on his shoes, and in a minute he'll come through this door----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. All I'll say is: &quot;Welcome, beloved&quot;--did you put some of that
swell soap of Alma's on his washstand?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. And how many times have I set here and thought to
myself: has he even got a decent bed under him?--and--and--have the
savages eaten him up already? And now all of a sudden here he is,
Father--Father we've got him again! May the luck keep up!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Look here a minute--does this look all right?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Quiet!--He's coming. Your tie's slipped up again! I'm
ashamed of you! (<i>Smoothes the cover of the arm-chair</i>) Lord, how
nervous I am!</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>bursts into the room and runs to his parents, who stand
stiffly before him, embarrassed.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Good morning. Father!--Good morning, Mother I (<i>He
embraces his mother and repeatedly kisses her hand</i>) I
am--absolutely--inhumanly--happy!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. &quot;Welcome, beloved son&quot;--(<i>As </i><span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>bows over his hand he
rubs it on his trousers</i>) You're going to kiss my hand?!!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Certainly, if you'll let me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Extending his hand</i>) Now you can see what a good son he is!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Looking about</i>) And here is where I once--I hardly know--is
it really possible?--Or am I actually dreaming still? That would
be too bad--Oh,--and the homesickness!--Lord in heaven, that
homesickness!--Just think! You sit out there at night in some corner,
and everything you have left appears about you, living;--mother,
father,--the court, the garden, the factory--and then all of a sudden
you see the long palm branches waving over you, or a parrot screams in
the distance and you come to yourself and realise that you are all
alone at the other end of the world! Brrr!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Parrots? That must be nice! Here only the rich folks can have
'em!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Yes, and if you only knew how I worried these last years, and
even on the journey home, for fear I shouldn't find everything the way
my longing had painted it!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Why?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. There was a man--otherwise a dear friend, my best friend,
too--who tried to prepare me for disappointment. You have become
foreign, he said, and you shouldn't try to put together what Fate has
separated so long ago--Heaven knows what else he said--and I was almost
afraid of him, and you, and myself too! Thank God that doesn't bother
me any more; every single thing has come out as I hoped! Everything
I had imagined for ten years is exactly as I expected--there is
Father--there's Mother, sweet and simple and (<i>Tenderly</i>) a bit of a
chatterbox! (<i>Stretching himself</i>) But what are these two young arms
for? Just watch! They've learned to make money!---And the sisters
will soon be ready too! Just see!--And here is father's old
paste-pot--(<i>Strokes the paste-pot</i>) And my confirmation
certificate--framed! And the machinery makes the same, dear old noise!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. You never slept a wink on account of that old
machine--eh? It bumps and bangs the whole night!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I was never sung to sleep by a sweeter lullaby, Mother. When I
was almost asleep I kept saying: snort if you want, puff if you like,
you old horse! Keep at it, but work as you will while I am lying here
in bed, <i>you</i> can't do anything for the glory of the house of Muhlingk.
<i>Here</i> is a lever that must be reckoned with! Wasn't that a proud
thought?--And then my heart warmed for our benefactor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Huh!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What, Father?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Aw, nuthin'!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And I have sworn that I won't slacken in his service until I've
drawn my last breath!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. I should think by this time you'd have done about enough for
them!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. You've scraped and slaved for them for ten years!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Oh, it wasn't as bad as that, Mother. But now let's not talk
about them this way any more. Every day we have one reason or other for
thanking the Muhlingks. The letters I had from the Councillor, and from
Kurt especially,--he's a partner now,--were like letters from a close
friend.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Kurt--Oh, he's a fine young gentleman! But as for the
rest--&quot;The Moor has paid his debt&quot;<a name="div2Ref_04" href="#div2_04">[4]</a> as the Berliner says--show me the
rabble! (<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>swallows his answer and turns away, frowning</i>) But,
Bobby, look around! Don't you notice anything? He don't see anything,
Mother!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, stop your chatter!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Chatter! Ho! When I try to welcome my dear son back to his
father's house, then it's chatter! (<i>Leads </i><span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>to the placard</i>)

W--what do you say to that, eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Did you make that, Father, you with your lame arm?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Ah! I make lots of things. If the poor old cripple didn't
take a hand this fine family would have starved long ago!--(<i>Rather
roughly</i>) What are you standing there staring at. Mother? Where's the
coffee?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Well, well! (<i>Starts to go</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Hurrying after her</i>) Oh, Mother, he didn't mean anything!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Mean anything? Ha! Ha! he's only talking that way to
make you think he's the man of the house! (<i>She goes out</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>After a pause, he tries to soothe over the unpleasantness</i>)

You still paste boxes. Father?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Still at it!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And the arm doesn't bother you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. My arm, ha! ha! ha! my arm! Do you want to see how I do it!
First the pasteboard--so--then the fold--so! (<i>With great speed he
sweeps the pastebrush across two sheets of cardboard, pressing them
into place with his left elbow</i>) Who could beat your old cripple at
that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You are a regular juggler.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. That's what! But who admits it? Who appreciates me? Who
appreciates me? Nobody! How could the daughters--one of 'em already a
Missus--respect me when their own mother gives 'em such a bad example!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Indignantly</i>) Father!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Yes, you're a long way from her lap--far away cows have long
horns--There, it's &quot;dear little Mother! sweet little sister!&quot;--But
if you knew what I've had to stand! Not once does she give me
horse-car-fare when I want to go to town for a glass of beer!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Are you quite fair to her? Doesn't she cherish you as the apple
of her eye?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Lord, I didn't mean to say anything against her--shh!--here
she comes! (<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Frau Heinecke </span><i>with a steaming coffee-pot</i>) Sit
down, Bobby,--No, here in the arm-chair! Wait a minute! (<i>Pulls off the
covering from the chair</i>) Such a fine gentleman ought to sit on pure
silk!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Yes, and the other's just the same! Two pieces we've
got! And have you seen the pier-glass? All gold creepers, and the glass
in one piece! Augusta's husband says it cost at least two hundred
marks!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Where did all these wonderful things come from.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. From the Councillor!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. He gives you things like this?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Naw, only----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) Ssh! don't you know that Herr Kurt doesn't
want it known? (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Robert</span>) Yes, last Christmas he gave us the mirror,
and this Christmas the two chairs. Father, quit boring holes in the
pound cake!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Really, I don't like this sort of generosity!</p>

<p class="normal">Frau Heinecke (<i>Pouring out coffee</i>) This furniture 'd be too good
for some people! But when we have such fine visitors and such a
distinguished gentleman for a son, and such an awful talented
daughter----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Alma?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Yessir! We did everything for our girl we were able to do.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. And you always sent money----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. So that she should have a proper schooling, and learn millinery
and bookkeeping. That's what we agreed on.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Yes--that was before--!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Before? Hasn't she the same position now?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Not for the last six months.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What is she doing now?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Proudly</i>) She is cultivating her voice!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Why, I never heard she was musical!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Awful musical!</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<i>They drink the coffee.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. She was examined by some Italian singer--Seenyora or
something--she said she had never heard anything like it before and she
would take it as an honor to develop Alma's voice herself at her own
cost.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. But why did you keep that from me?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, it was such a long way, clear out to India, you
forget such things--and then, we wanted to give you a surprise!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Gets up and walks excitedly up and down</i>) Auguste really
takes good care of her?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Certainly. She never lets her eye off her. Alma eats at
her house and practises at her house and when she stays too late to
catch the horsecar she sleeps there--same as she did last night.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And when she stays away all night, doesn't that worry you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Huh! Big girl like that!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. No, not when we've brought her up so well--and she's
with Auguste, too! She ought to be here soon. The milk-man took the
letter over early. How surprised she'll be!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And Auguste is happy?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, so--so. Her husband boozes a little, and when it
comes to working, he ain't much, but----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. But when it comes to sulking and raising Cain, he's right at
home!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. But, all in all, they get along all right. Auguste has
furnished up two swell rooms, and rented 'em to a gentleman from
Potsdam that ain't there half the time, but pays for the whole month!
That brings in many a pretty penny. He pays a whole mark just for his
coffee in the morning, (<i>Goes to the window</i>) There she comes! And
she's brought her husband along, too!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What? Isn't Alma with her?</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Auguste </span><i>and </i><span class="sc2">Michalski </span><i>come in.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. Well, well, here you are! (<i>They kiss each other</i>) Everything
has been going fine with you, hasn't it? What's the use of asking? When
a man goes around in clothes like those!--Of course everything ain't
gold that glitters--here's my husband!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Well, brother-in-law, give me your hand,--one of the family!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. Honored! Don't often happen that a horny hand like this is
so honored!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That doesn't sound very brotherly. (<i>To Auguste</i>) Where's Alma?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. Our Princess was afraid she wasn't beautiful enough for the
foreign brother! She had to stay and burn her bangs first. (<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>is
deeply concerned</i>) She'll probably come by the next car. Where did you
get the pound-cake? (<span class="sc2">Frau Heinecke </span><i>passes the cake around and </i>
<span class="sc2">Michalski</span> and <span class="sc2">Auguste </span><i>eat</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Eat another piece, Bobby!</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>refuses, but the others eat.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>After a pause</i>) What do you say to that, Michalski,
&quot;Welcome, beloved son.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Eating</i>) Nonsense!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Surprised</i>) Brother-in-law!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. What? What I did with this noble heart and this lame arm!</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>pacifies him.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. I'm a simple man and I ain't afraid to say what I think!
I've got no use for that kind of rot and nonsense! When a man has got
to work the way we do with his stomach empty and a whip at his back----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. 'Specially when a man goes walking at eleven o'clock and eats
pound-cake to boot!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. Are you two at it again? (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Michalski</span>) Will you never shut
up? Can't you see he's in his second childhood?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. I'm in--Good!--Now you see! That's the way I'm treated by my
own children!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Aside to </i><span class="sc2">Auguste</span>) Really, sister, I never thought you would
say a thing like that!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. What are you talking about?</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Wilhelm</span>.)</p>

<i>and </i><span class="sc2">Michalski </span><i>shake hands with him</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Who is the pretty bouquet for? That must be for somebody
in the city.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. No, it's for you ... You are the young gentleman? (Robert
<i>nods--cordially</i>) Awful glad to know you! (<i>About to offer his hand</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Smiling</i>) Very kind of you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. The honorable family sends you a hearty welcome and these
flowers. They are the rarest in the conservatory. But, between you and
me, the flowers came from the Gnadiges Fraulein. And the Gnadiges
Fraulein was pretty anxious to----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Were you commissioned to say that, too? (<i>Controlling his
feelings</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. No, not----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Then keep it to yourself!</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<i>The servant starts to go.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Wouldn't you like to have a piece of pound-cake with us,
Wilhelm? There's plenty left!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Please, Mother! (<i>Gives </i><span class="sc2">Wilhelm </span><i>a gold-piece</i>) The man has
his pay--Tell the Councillor that the Count von Trast-Saarburg and I
beg the honor of a meeting with him at three o'clock! You may go!
(<span class="sc2">Wilhelm </span><i>goes</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. A count! What sort of a count?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. A friend of mine, Mother, to whom I am under great obligation.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Softly to </i><span class="sc2">Michalski</span>) He pretends to have a count for a
friend!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Wait, I'll put the flowers in water. But you oughtn't to
have been so harsh with Wilhelm, Bobby! He's a good friend of ours.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. Us common folks don't have counts for friends!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. We have to be contented with servants!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Yes, you must be nice to Wilhelm, Robert, for our sakes;
he can do a lot for us! How many pieces of roasts and how many bottles
of wine has he slipped us!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And you accepted them, Mother?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Why not, my boy! We're poor folks--we ought to be glad
to get things like that for nothing!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Mother, I'll double my efforts; I'll give you what I can spare
for my bare living expenses. But promise me you won't take anything
more from that servant, will you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, that would be foolish pride and waste! You should
not look a gift-horse in the mouth! And he only wanted to do you a
favor, when he told you that about the Gnadiges Fraulein! That's
something special! Whenever I met her in the court, there wasn't a
single time when she didn't stop me and ask if there was any news from
you, and how you got on with the hot weather and all! And at the same
time she smiled so friendly--if you were a smart boy, Robert----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. For heaven's sake. Mother, stop!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. That wouldn't be so bad--two millions!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. Would you lend me a little then, eh, Brother-in-law?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Yes sir! D'ye see!</p>

main thing! Are you happy, too, brother?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Certainly, when I have reason to be.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. The great art is to be happy without any reason. Why are we
young? Oh, it's good to live! Every day something new!--And Berlin is
so lovely! You know--the Linden!--and the electric light! Have you seen
it yet? That's what I like the best of all. Everybody is so pretty and
pale, so interesting!--And the restaurants have all got electric lights
now, too. Grand!--I saw a chandelier in a cafe in the Donhoffplatz--it
was a great big wreath of flowers and every flower had a light in it!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Were you in the cafe?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. I? How could I be? Through the window it was! You don't have
things like that in India? Do you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. No, we certainty don't.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. We're pretty far advanced in culture here. Somebody told me that
Berlin was almost as beautiful as Paris. Is that so?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I don't know Paris, dear.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Ugh! That's a shame! Every young man ought to know Paris.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Ha I ha! ha! I'm a funny one! don't you think? Ha! ha! Yes,
that's the way! (<i>She goes about laughing, and rocks back and forth.

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. But how did he know----?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. He heard her singing--through the window on the court.
And the next thing, he said it was a sin and a shame that a voice like
hers----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. But why do you let Mother tell everything, Alma?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Michalski</span>) She's so modest.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. That a voice like mine should be wasted here in the alley--and
that <i>I</i> should not be wasted here in the alley, for that matter! It's
really an imposition on you, Gnadiges Fraulein, he said!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. I heard that myself: &quot;Gnadiges Fraulein!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. My daughter, yes sir!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. (<i>Quickly</i>) You don't need to go there. It's true!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Of course it's true. But I'd like to hear the teacher's own
opinion about your voice. (<span class="sc2">Alma </span><i>looks quickly toward </i><span class="sc2">Auguste</span>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. You can go to her lesson with her tomorrow.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Yes, to-morrow!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Good! (<i>Gets up and walks back and forth excitedly</i>) I don't
want to make you feel badly, dear, but I must admit I don't share your
great hopes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. How many a young girl is enticed into these things purely
through ambition and vanity! And it's dangerous! More dangerous than
you realize--Of course I am sure that the young manager has the highest
and the noblest of motives, but--Well, however that may be, to-morrow
I'll hear myself what the teacher says, and if my doubts are
groundless, I promise to take care of you myself, and we shan't rest a
moment until you have reached the climax of your art! (<span class="sc2">Alma </span><i>takes the
vase from the table and buries her face in the flowers</i>) Wouldn't
it be strange if we were to owe everything--even this piece of good
fortune--to the house of Muhlingk!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Mama, who sent me this bouquet?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. That's a welcome to--(<i>Indicates </i><span class="sc2">Robert</span>) from the
Gnadiges Fraulein!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Oh, from her! (<i>She puts down the vase</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Wait a minute! One question! It seems that every time I mention
the &quot;Avenue&quot; or any of the family, someone bursts out laughing, or
makes some disapproving remark. Herr Muhlingk junior is the only one
who seems to meet with your approval. Now, frankly, what have you
against our benefactor? What has he done to offend you? (<i>A pause</i>)

You, for instance. Brother-in-law, what made you laugh so scornfully?
(<i>Silence</i>) Or you. Alma, that you won't have anything to do with the
flowers that came from Miss Muhlingk! Mother just told me how kind she
has always been!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Kind, is she? She's a stuck-up thing, that can't poke her nose
high enough in the air when she meets me!--Never says a word to me;
why, it's all she can do to return my bow! Oh, she----!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. She's the same way to me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Sorrowfully, to himself</i>) That isn't like her!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Shocked,--interrupting her</i>) Mother! But I'd forgotten: I've
brought some presents for my sisters, and you, too, Brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Jumping up greedily</i>) What have you got? Where is it?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Sadly reproving</i>) No, mother, I wasn't listening!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Defiantly</i>) And I want a new paste-pot--you ought to be
able to afford that! (<i>The three come back from the bedroom</i>. <span class="sc2">Auguste </span>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Puffing at the stem of his pipe</i>) Course it don't draw!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Alma</span>, <i>who is playing with her jewels</i>) Are you
satisfied, Alma? Look at the three blue stones, they are Indian
sapphire.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Very pretty! But to tell the truth, I like the dark-blue
sapphires more! They have such beautiful brilliancy!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. How do you know so much about such things?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Oh--from the shop windows! People of our sort like to look in
windows!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And what's that shining in your ear?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Paste, that's all! Two Marks a pair!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Dear, you mustn't wear things like that!--Promise me you'll
take them off this minute--and I'll show you another special surprise
that I've brought you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. (<i>Sullenly, taking off the ear-rings</i>) As you please!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. It's the dress of a hindoo Princess--looted on a military

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What does that mean?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. Simple enough! Herr Kurt has his carriage, and since he's an
obliging young man he gave Alma a standing invitation to ride to the
city with him.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What? She allowed that? You, sister, you accepted that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. A poor girl ought to be glad enough to ride in a carriage once in

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. And you save car-fare!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Good heavens! And what do the ladies on the Avenue say to that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Oh, they don't know anything about it! When I ride with him he
stops the carriage at the back doorway where only the tradespeople go
in.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. So much the worse! What a disgusting implication in all this
secrecy! Alma, haven't you felt that yourself?--Alma, come here!--Look
me in the eyes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That's impossible, my friend! Our ways will have to part!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Nonsense!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I shall ask my employer to give me a position here. The climate
in India--you understand----?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. That's pleasant! He doesn't want to leave his mother's
apron-strings again, eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Don't make fun of me. Since we're going to part--I have to
say it some time--I thank you, you kind old wicked fellow, for all
you've done for me. It was the most fortunate moment of my life when
you saw me standing feverishly behind my young employer in the Club at
Buitenzorg, when he was throwing one hundred-gulden note after the
other onto the green cloth.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Why was I such a fool? If you're going to--Ugh! It isn't decent!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Trast! don't hurt me. See, I owe everything to you. When I
heard your name then--the name of Trast and Company that is known from
Yokohama to Aden, I felt as though I were standing before the Kaiser
himself!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Kaiser, by the grace of coffee!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Muhlingk's undertaking in Batavia was on the road to ruin that
minute.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. No wonder, when it had the worst good-for-nothing in the
Archipelago for its head.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. There was nothing ahead of me but failure and discharge. And
then you took the poor home-sick clerk under your pinion, your name
opened a hundred doors for me and I grew up into manhood under your
care! And Herr Benno Muhlingk led his merry life as he pleased, and I
ran the entire business.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. And the end of the story is that the firm of Muhlingk, along
with its clever representative, is a few thousands richer because of
us. It's a shame! you ought to have profited by it yourself. Well, I'll
open your employer's eyes to the kind of a man you've been! If he
doesn't at least make you a partner, I shall declare such a corner in
coffee, in my righteous wrath, that the noble German oak-leaf<a name="div2Ref_06" href="#div2_06">[6]</a> shall
be valued as never before. But, seriously, why do you insist on this
caprice of remaining with the Muhlingks? I offer you a tremendous
salary and a pair of trousers every Christmas. (<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>shakes his
head</i>) It isn't only gratitude that makes a man cling to such an insane
idea! Of course if the inventory of the firm included a fair German
maiden--(<i>Aside</i>) Aha! (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Robert</span>) Speaking of maidens, just listen
to what happened to me last night. After we had left each other I
wandered aimlessly along the street. A friendly poster invited into a
masked ball. A hundred Indian dancers were to present their exciting
dance according to the advertisement--well, that is my specialty--I
went in. Everything seemed arranged to lead a young monk to forget his
oath. And then suddenly there came before me a young girl, tender and
fresh as a half-ripe peach. She seemed to be without a partner. I
presented myself. Not at all bashful, she begged for a little plaything
that hung on my watch-chain, in a little baby voice. It was my patron
saint Ganesa, god of success, who rides on a little rat. And I smelled
a rat myself. What do you suppose I found beneath her childish
innocence? Naif depravity!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Nervously</i>) Are such things possible?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Listen. My heart always beats according to the tempo required by
the custom of the land whose hospitality I am enjoying. I always keep a
harem in the Orient; in Italy I climb the garden wall by moonlight, in
France I pay the dressmaker's bills, and--Lord!--in Germany--well, I
know the return journey from virtue, too! All according to rule! In the
Orient one loves with his senses, in Italy with his imagination, in
France with his pocketbook, in Germany with his conscience! So I tried
to change this sinning child to a repentant Magdalen. Before I could
get started, however, the champagne had to be uncorked--then came a
gentleman, half demon and half fool, and claimed the lady as his own. I
respected the ancient law of precedence, and went to bed the poorer by
one good act. But I would give a good deal to know how it happened that
a sweet little thing like--(<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>covers his face with his hands</i>)

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Oh, if I had only never seen my home again!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Ha! so that's where the wind blows from.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I am ashamed of the position I was born in. My own people have
become nothing to me. My whole being shudders from contact with them. I
can't trust my mind, one mad suspicion follows the other! Trast! I
almost believe I don't even respect the breast that nursed me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. That's simply rot!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. If I could only explain what I have suffered! Every serious
word strikes me like a blow! And every pleasantry like a slap in the
face! It seems as though they could talk of nothing but what hurts
me--I thought I was coming back to a home,--instead of that it's a
strange world where I dare hardly breathe!--Advise me what to do!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Pack your trunk!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That would be a cowardly and heartless retreat! Do they deserve
that--My own parents!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Listen--drop the pathetic note--The matter is simple enough for
us. We've studied caste in its native wilds. The same castes exist
here. They aren't established by food-laws, or marriage-rules and
religious etiquette; those were simple. The chasm that can't be bridged
is the difference of feeling--each caste has its own sense of honor,
its own nice distinctions, its own ideas, yes, even its own speech.
Unhappy is the man who has fallen out of his own caste and hasn't the
courage to cut himself off from it entirely. Just such a declasse are
you!--and you know, I was the same thing myself! Just what you are
feeling now, I went through years ago. How do you suppose I felt,
<i>chic</i> young cavalry officer, when I woke one morning to the
realization that I had gambled away ninety thousand talers that had to
be paid in twenty-four hours. What good did it do me to ride home and
throw myself at my father's feet? He would have put his head in pawn to
save the honor of our name--but he had already done so! And, since he
had nothing else to give me, he gave me at least his curse!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Brooding</i>) How you had the courage to live after that!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Do you know what happened then?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Absently, tortured by his own thoughts</i>) I know
nothing--nothing--nothing!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Then listen to me! Perhaps it may be of use to you. When my
comrades said farewell to me they did me the last favor of placing a
cocked revolver on my table. I looked at the matter from all sides. I
took for granted that, without my honor I could not live. Then, as I
pointed the thing to my forehead the thought came to me--this is
brutal, this is silly! How different are you to-day from what you were
three days ago? Perhaps you deserved punishment for having promised
money that you didn't have; but not death! For thousands of years men
have enjoyed the light of the sun without letting the phantom of honor
darken it. To-day nine hundred and ninety thousands of people belong to
that same class, live as they did, and work as they did, and enjoy the
sun as they did! Twelve years later--of course my debt was long since
cancelled--when I came back to Europe a sort of reconciliation took
place between my father and me. But it was only an outward
reconciliation. If he had found me, like a prodigal son, lying on his
doorstep, he would have lifted me up from the dirt with trembling hands
and pressed me to his bosom. Since I carried my head a little defiantly
and was in a position to help him out with half a million or so he
couldn't forgive me. A few weeks later I left. The rich coffee seller
and the poor cavalier had nothing in common.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And now he's dead!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. May he find peace in the heaven he believed in! Now the moral:
leave your parents their point of view. You can't change that. Give
where there is need--give all you have, and then--come with me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I can't! Listen, I'll tell you why. I didn't tell you before
because I was ashamed. I have a little sister, she was a baby when I
left. Oh, how I longed to see her and looked forward to the meeting!
And I wasn't disappointed, for she was prettier and sweeter than I had
hoped! But my love for her before a thousand fears I am afraid to
mention! For what she does and lets others do with her--in perfect
innocence, of course--goes against every feeling of honor I possess!
Just now when you were telling about that girl in the dance-hall; a
cold shiver went through me! Because--no, no, a thousand times no! Here
is my place! I must stay here, to stand or fall!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. I admit you have reasons that are at least worth considering.
But you are excited. I'll wager you are looking at the dark side!</p>

beast. Perhaps that doesn't interest you either, Lori?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. They will probably come often. They haven't anything else to
do. (<i>Looking at the clock--aside</i>) Oh, how the time drags! (<i>The
servant goes out</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. You must not speak so harshly about these gentlemen, my
child. You know Lothar wants to pay court to you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Really?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. Haven't you noticed it?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. I haven't paid any particular attention.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. (<i>To her husband</i>) It's unbearable, Theodore!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. We've had enough of this tone, my child. Even the pride in
your paternal bank account has its limits.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Looking at him</i>) Pride in the paternal bank account?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Well, how can we explain this manner you have assumed for the
last ten years, sending home every rich and respected man who has
proposed to you?--I am a simple, middle-class man. I made my own way
with my own help----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. That is to say, he married a rich wife.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. What's that, Kurt?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. An exclamation of admiration, Father; nothing else.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. No, I didn't have it as easy as you, my boy. You might well
follow my example. I don't like to play the spender and I don't care to
see it in my children, either. That is the only way one can live
tastefully!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. --and cheap, too!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Your accusation doesn't apply to me, papa.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. Will you condescend to give us an explanation then?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Mama!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. (<i>Nervously</i>) Well?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Rising</i>) Oh, why can't you let me work out my own salvation?
I am modest enough--I only ask to be allowed to live my own life.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. You call that modest? If that is modest, what is to become of
the sanctity of family ties?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. (<i>To her husband</i>) Do you hear that? I haven't slept for
nights and nights!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Because of me, mama?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. Every day these mad ideas, these unconventional acts!
Now what does it mean this time, when you plunder the hothouse to send
flowers to a clerk!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. You mean Robert?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. The young Herr Heinecke, I mean.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. He isn't a clerk. He is almost a member of the family!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Oh, thank you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. (<i>Mildly</i>) That is, we brought him up out of the gutter.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. (<i>As the servant enters</i>) Eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. The young Herr Heinecke from the alley sends word that he will
take the liberty of----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. --calling, with your permission. He named another gentleman.
Count Trast, or someone----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. (<i>Jumping up</i>) What! Count Trast! Trast and Company, Kurt!
The coffee King. (<i>Motions the servant off</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. What luck that clerk has!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Oh, we must invite him to the house, Amalie.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. Very good,--to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. What! and not invite Robert Heinecke too?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) Better and better!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Well, perhaps you are right. When one descends to the level
of these people one really unites their interests with the interests of
the firm. A thing like that often brings in thousands, Kurt. The young
fellow did very well under Benno's direction and inasmuch as I'm
thinking of sending him for ten years into the Antilles, I----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Indignantly</i>) Oh, I did not mean it that way, papa!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Oh, that's all right.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. And, Kurt, you must take care that the young fellow
doesn't make any <i>faux pas</i>. He comes from the alley, you know. A thing
like that might spoil the whole affair.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Standing up</i>) Pardon me, did you expect I would invite my
friends?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Certainly, your friends, too! Bachelors always have plenty of
time.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Standing up</i>) Pardon me, I should like to ask to be excused
from doing that. I can't be expected to introduce gentlemen of good
family to the son of (<i>Indicating the alley</i>) Herr Heinecke.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) Would you rather have the brother of Miss Heinecke
here?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Shocked, then gathering himself together</i>) What do you mean?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Be thankful I don't insist on an answer.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Really!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Shall I?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. So you're threatening me, are you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. My dear children, in this house we won't have any scenes,
please.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. Don't let's pay any attention to it, Theodore. I'll lie
down now and rest for a minute or two--Won't you?</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Muhlingk </span><i>kisses her ceremoniously on the forehead.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) The good old days! Goodbye! (<span class="sc2">Frau Muhlingk </span><i>goes
towards door</i>. <span class="sc2">Muhlingk </span><i>rings</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Hurrying after </i><span class="sc2">Frau Muhlingk</span>) Mother!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. (<i>Turns around, speaks nervously, but in a friendly
tone</i>) Never mind! It's all right! (<i>She goes out</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Ask any visitors to come into my office.</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Muhlingk </span><i>and the </i><span class="sc2">Servant </span><i>go out</i>. <span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>also starts to go.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. It seems to me we have something to say to each other.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. We? Oh, no!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. You don't want to draw me into an argument, perhaps?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. It doesn't seem to suit you when I take a notion to see a little
of the world. Because you are four years older than I, and because
you taught me to walk, you'd still like to have me tied to your
apron-strings. You--but I can go--alone now. There are ladies who have
said I go too far. Let me find heaven in my own way.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. I have never interfered with you. Go on, play the
man-of-the world as much as you like, but have the courage to admit it.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. What good would that do?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. You play the dutiful son and then make fun of your parents
behind their backs. Believe me, Kurt; you are ruining your character.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Laughing</i>) No!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. There is just one thing I ask of you--at least keep this house
and its surroundings sacred.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. We'll do that with the help of the Lord!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Do you know what they are whispering around the factory?
That you are paying far too much attention to Robert Heinecke's
sister--that you----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Shrugging his shoulders</i>) Yes, and you allow yourself to carry
the gossip of the backstairs about----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Kurt, not that tone! I defended you from Mama and Papa to-day.
The next time I shan't do it. And remember one thing: Robert has come
back.--If he finds his sister guilty--don't worry, I wouldn't dare
think it!--But the girl is frivolous and vain! If it <i>were</i> so--and you
were to blame, Kurt, take care! He would break you in pieces!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Who? My clerk?--with his sample-case?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. And you stoop to steal this from your clerk.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. What's that? Steal--steal what?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. His position in the world! His good name!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Well, where were you yesterday?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Affectedly</i>) Ah, by Jove, you make an awful demand on a man's
memory. What was I doing yesterday? First I went riding, then I had a
conference with Father.--Coffee is sinking again.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. Alarmingly--53 and a half.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Alarmingly, is not the right word. It <i>is</i> sinking. We'll make
a fight. Then I made some visits, then I dined at the Officers'
Association----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Looking up</i>) Ah, you are an officer?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Insulted</i>) I thought you knew, Gnadiges Fraulein?--I am a

card!</p>

astride Papa's desk chair.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Sharply</i>) Oh I say, old fellow!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. The desk chair isn't the slowest horse in the race for fortune
you know, Herr Lieutenant.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. Oh, that was good!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. But I looked for you last evening.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. The evening.--We were invited somewhere? Where? It isn't quite
clear in my memory now. We won't discuss the matter. You seem to be
amused, Gnadiges Fraulein?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Is that forbidden?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. But really, you know, you in your pride and seclusion, have
hardly an idea what the word <i>saison</i> means in our good German tongue.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. It is quite two months, Gnadiges Fraulein, that I have done what
you might really call sleeping.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. And that was on a billiard table.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Oh, our respected Kurt meant that as a joke! But if you knew
what it meant to be a martyr to amusement, you would understand what we
mean.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. I have made such an effort to understand you that I already
begin to feel sorry for you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. (<i>Aside to </i><span class="sc2">Lothar</span>) I believe the girl is making fun of us.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Aside, arrogantly</i>) Every woman tries to be a coquette.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Who has gone over to </i><span class="sc2">Lenore</span>, <i>aside</i>) You don't need to be so
disagreeable.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Rocking</i>) Hm? (<i>Goes on reading</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Might I ask what it is that takes so much of the Gnadiges
Fraulein's attention.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) If he would only let her be!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Something that would hardly be of interest to the martyrs of
amusement--for it concerns the martyrs of labor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Ah, I see.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. (<i>Getting up</i>) But weren't we going to see the horse?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Ah yes! you two go ahead--The martyrs of labor interest me more
than the Gnadiges Fraulein believes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) Oh, the poor devil!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Come, Stengel, come! (<i>They go out</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Looking impatiently at the clock</i>) In what way can I be of
service to you, Herr Brandt?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Gnadiges Fraulein, I very much regret that you quite
misunderstand me, for although I admit that I----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. And in order to prove that, you are willing to waste----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. A moment, please!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) A proposal!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. My faults may be without number, but, Gnadiges Fraulein, I am a
man of honor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. I should think that that was to be taken for granted from the
son of a respectable family, Herr Brandt, and as little worthy of
praise as the fact that he wears a well-cut coat.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Then you respect honor no more?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Pardon me. I meant no disrespect to the ill-clad. But one
doesn't bring them into the parlor. But I interrupted you, Herr Brandt.
Perhaps I do misunderstand you. Please continue.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. I must admit, Gnadiges Fraulein, you have intimidated me. And
that is something! For what is a man without courage?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Ah, that is another thing. Courage, I can respect! But what
have you done so far that has shown your courage?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Ask my friends. That at least is above reproach.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. In other words, you have fought a duel.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. One doesn't discuss such things before ladies.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. But we hear about them just the same. We are here to offer the
victor his laurels. Did you ever break a lance in defence of a
conviction which you know in your heart you yourself have violated?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Indignantly</i>) How can you ask that? Such a thing could never
occur to me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Or have you never silently borne an unworthy suspicion?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. I? Silently? On the contrary.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Never?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Never, Fraulein.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Then one can't be absolutely certain about your courage,

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. You have been away from home a long time, Herr Count?</p>

You mustn't freeze in cold Germany!--Wait, I'll start up the fire!

you have up your sleeve. I'll parry it.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. That's the last thing I want to do.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Well?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You said: &quot;Be true to me, Robert.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Is that what I said? Exactly that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Such a thing one doesn't forget.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. They had forbidden us to call each other by our first names.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. And why don't we do it any more?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You are playing with me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. You are right, my friend. And I must not do it. It would look
like coquetry, although it is nothing but the joy of seeing you again.
You have shown me plainly enough that the dream of our childhood is
over.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. It must be. Your father lifted me out of the gutter in a moment
of overflowing generosity. Everything that I think and know and feel I
must thank him for. And for that very reason I have lost the right of
independent action. I am a dependent of this house, and have not the
right to approach its young mistress--in any way whatever.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Your own pride punishes your lying words!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Perhaps it is my pride that forces me to accept this position!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. And you are not willing to sacrifice a little of it for my
sake?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Don't torture me! It isn't that alone! Only think what I am
suffering. For the first time, this moment, when I sit opposite you, do
I realize anything like a home-coming! But I would be terribly selfish
if I allowed myself to admit this feeling. Back there in the alley is
my family!--Father, mother, sister--and this family--is my family! Oh,
I tell you things have happened back there that you in your goodness
can't even imagine.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. My dear friend, one doesn't have to go to India to become
estranged from one's family.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You, too?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. It is better not to speak of it. I am ashamed of myself. I am
even more of an outcast than you. I have lost all sense of duty.
A sort of gloomy ill-will has come over me and now it is almost
arrogance--towards my own people and all the others about them--and I'm
not arrogant or proud by nature! Tell me, what is it that----?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Shh!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Trast</span>) Well, until to-morrow then. Count.--Ah, there is
the young man. (<i>Extending his hand</i>) Welcome, welcome, do you want to
go over the report at once?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I only came to present my respects, Herr Councillor, my papers
aren't unpacked yet.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Well, well, there's no hurry. But what are you doing here,
Leonore?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. I simply wanted to say how d'ye do to Robert.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Mm--But you know that Mama has been asking for you. Come,
young man, I have plans for you; plans. You know, Count, we have no
secrets from you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. You can get to know him better if you are alone with him. (<i>To </i>
<span class="sc2">Robert</span>) I'll wait for you here.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Shaking </i><span class="sc2">Robert's </span><i>hand</i>) Au revoir, Robert.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Hm! (<i>Reprovingly. He goes out with </i><span class="sc2">Robert</span>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Count, you heard--? I must go.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Gnadiges Fraulein! (<span class="sc2">Leonore </span><i>goes to door, he watches her, she
turns and he shakes his finger at her</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Surprised</i>) What do you mean, Count?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Hm--I mean! (<i>He claps his hands</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. And what does that mean?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. That means--(<i>Through his hands</i>) Bravo!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Dignified</i>) I don't understand you. Count--ah! (<i>She bursts
out laughing and goes up frankly and puts out her hand</i>) Yes, I do
understand.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Taking her hand in both his</i>) That's better.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Count!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Fraulein! (<span class="sc2">Leonore </span><i>goes out</i>) She's a splendid specimen--that

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Stengel </span><i>who is coming in</i>) Courage, courage, my boy! Come
in.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Recognising </i><span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>as he comes in with </i><span class="sc2">Brandt</span>) He--here!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Sees </i><span class="sc2">Trast</span>; <i>startled, goes up to him, in a low voice</i>) You
wished to see me, sir?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. No, but I'm glad to see you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. With whom have I the honor----?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Count Trast.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Astonished and very polite</i>) Ah, we may thank--thank--our
employe--er--our--a traveling acquaintanceship, I suppose--for this
visit?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. You are the son of the house?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. I beg your pardon, yes! At your service! Naturally--ah, Count, we
are both men-of-the world enough to forget the affair of last night.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. You think so?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. The girl is nice, I ought to know if anyone does. All honor to
your good taste. But you must admit that I was in the right. I hope
there will be no rivalry?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Especially, as the girl's brother is the best friend I have?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Frightened, controls himself, then, after a pause</i>) What do you
intend to do?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. I have not decided as yet. If I can dissuade him from his
imaginary duties to your house, and if I find you prepared to break off
all further relationship, then perhaps I can remain silent.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. And otherwise?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. That would be a matter for Herr Heinecke to settle.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Do you think I would accept a challenge from my clerk?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Your what?--Oh, I see.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Count, do what you please.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. That is a habit of mine. Herr Heinecke is at this moment in your
father's office. Permit me to remain here a few minutes in order that I
may shorten your meeting. I should like to prevent you two from shaking
hands.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. The room is yours, Count.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. I thank you. (<i>They separate, and </i><span class="sc2">Trast </span><i>looks at the
pictures</i>. <span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>walks excitedly away from the others</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc">Hugo</span>) What happened between those two? If I remember
rightly there was a Count Trast in our regiment who came to a bad end.
Wait a moment.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. (<i>Nervously</i>) You aren't going to start a quarrel?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Why not? The other fellow has some scheme. (<i>He approaches </i>
<span class="sc2">Trast</span>) The Count seems to like solitude.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Turning</i>) Decidedly!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. That is rather impolite.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Looking at him squarely</i>) Ah! you seem to be carrying your
sense of honor on your shoulder, Herr--er--pardon!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. My name is Lothar Brandt and I feel that it is necessary to add
that I am Lieutenant of the Reserves in the Cuirassier Regiment &quot;Crown
Prince.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Politely</i>) Is that all?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Threateningly</i>) Is that all, Count?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Pardon me! One serves in the Reserves during war time only. When
I came back I hoped that I could live in peace.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. You are mistaken, Count, one serves in the Reserves during the
rifle practice, as well.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Do you need me for rifle practice?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Permit me, Count, to ask you a question.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. With pleasure.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. In the regiment to which it is my great honor to belong there
was formerly a young fellow who bore the same name as yours.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Ah? Then it was probably I.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Sharply</i>) The man left the army under a cloud.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Exactly! Exactly! (<i>Very polite</i>) And if you wish to say in
other words, that when we meet on the street you don't care to
recognize me--I release you from the necessity of greeting--I can do
without it. (<i>Bows and picks up a portfolio which he examines</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. (<i>Enthusiastically</i>) Well, <i>I</i> was never despatched as elegantly
as that, (<i>He approaches </i><span class="sc2">Trast </span><i>and bows deeply</i>) --Permit me--my
name
is Stengel!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Turning</i>) Charmed!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. Stengel! (<span class="sc2">Trast </span><i>bows--they talk</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Comes forward and joins </i><span class="sc2">Lothar</span>) Man, what are you trying to
do. That's the almighty firm of Trast and Company.--Do you want to ruin
your father's business?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Dismayed</i>) Why didn't you tell me before?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Whatever happens we must straighten the matter out</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. If you can do it in perfectly good form.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Pardon me. Count--my friend regrets----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Regrets is hardly the word, Kurt.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Stuttering</i>) Well--er--er----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Perhaps our friend would like to consider our little
conversation as not having taken place?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. We can go as far as that at least, Kurt.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. I must keep pace with his generosity, and--express the same
desire.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Then the matter is settled.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. And I take the liberty to express my pleasure at meeting
personally, the man whose work I have respected for so many years.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Very politely</i>) You see, Lieutenant, that it was not entirely
superfluous when I asked &quot;Is that all?&quot; As business men, we can
understand each other perfectly. Gentlemen, Herr Brandt Junior, heir to
the worthy firm of importers, Brandt and Stengel, with which I am
pleased to have business relations, has just given me a little
statement in private on the theme of &quot;Honor.&quot; Permit me to make the
answer public. (<i>They sit down</i>) In confidence, there is no such thing
as honor, (<i>All are astonished</i>) Don't be frightened. It won't hurt
you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. And what we call honor?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. What we commonly call honor is nothing more than the shadow we
throw in the sunlight of publicity. But the worst part of it is that we
have as many kinds of honor as we have business circles and strata. How
can one find his way among them?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>Sharply</i>) You are mistaken. Count. There is only one honor,
just as there is only one sun and one God. One must feel that--or he is
no gentleman.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Hm!--Permit me to tell you a little tale. In a journey through
Central Asia I stopped at the house of a Thibetan Chief. I was dusty
and footsore. He received me, sitting on his throne. Beside him was his
charming little wife. &quot;Rest yourself, traveler,&quot; he said to me, &quot;my
wife will prepare you a bath and then we men shall dine together.&quot; And
he gave me over to his young wife.--Gentlemen, if ever in my life my
self-control was put to test it was in that hour--And when I returned
to the hall, what did I find? The attendants under arms, threatening
voices and half-drawn swords. &quot;You must die!&quot; cried my host, &quot;you have
given a deadly insult to the honor of my house. You have scorned to
accept the most sacred thing I could offer you.&quot;--You see, gentlemen, I
am still living, for eventually the deficient sense of honor of the
barbaric European was forgiven. (<i>They laugh</i>) If you happen to know
any of our modern writers on the theme of adultery you might tell them
this story.</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<i>All laugh, and move gradually towards the left.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Continuing</i>) Gentlemen, I don't want to be considered immoral.
The study of the puzzles of civilization is a thing apart.--You see it
lies in the nature of your so-called honor, that it may only be
possessed by the certain few, the demi-gods; for it is an emotional
luxury that loses value in direct proportion as it is appropriated by
the rabble.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. But that is a paradox. Count. Is it not permitted to everyone to
be a man of honor?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. On the contrary. Then the poorest devil in the alley might
dispute the honor of a gentleman. (<span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>is perplexed</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. If he acts according to honor, then he must be a gentleman.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Hm! Really? May I tell you another, a shorter story?--But I am
afraid I'm boring you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar </span><i>and </i><span class="sc">Hugo</span>. (<i>Laughing</i>) No!--No!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. It took place somewhere in South America--the Spaniards are the
aristocrats there,--the population is a mixture of negroes, Indians,
and a sort of white trash. A product of this mixed race,--his name
was--hm--Pepe--had the opportunity of being transported to the Spanish
mother country where he (<i>Breathes on his left elbow</i>) absorbed a
little of the pure Castillan sense of honor. (<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>enters without
being heard and listens</i>) When he came back, after several years, he
found his little sister on all too intimate terms with a young
aristocrat--Gentleman, we mustn't get angry, Considering her origin it
was the girl's destiny. But the young fellow dared to attempt to avenge
his sister's honor, not as a mestizo but as a Hidalgo!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>In a hurt voice</i>) Listen, that means me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. You see, gentlemen, that was madness and he was treated as a
madman. Then the fellow showed his real nature. Like a thug he waited
for the young nobleman and he shot him down. He was sentenced, and even
under the very gallows the fool declared,--his name was Pepe--that he
was dying for his honor. Gentlemen, isn't that absurd?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Who has made his appearance unobserved</i>) You are mistaken, my
friend! This fool was right. I should have acted exactly the same way.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Oh, oh, it's you! (<i>Going quickly to him</i>) You don't know these
people! Don't look around. Come with me. (<i>Draws him toward the door</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Isn't that Kurt?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. They are strangers.--Come. You will excuse me, gentlemen? We are
in a hurry. Goodbye.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Kurt</span>) Now, I'll settle him. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Trast</span>) Permit me just
one more question, Count. (<i>Affectedly</i>) If you intend to do away with
honor entirely; what do you expect gentlemen of honor to put in its
place?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Straightening up</i>) Duty, young man--(<i>To himself</i>) This is
certainly unpleasant, Gentlemen----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>As </i><span class="sc2">Trast </span><i>and </i><span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>are about to leave</i>) It was a
great
honor to our house, Count.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Pardon me, but you are Herr Kurt Muhlingk?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. That is my name?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Confused</i>) But--aren't--? Of course, you don't recognize me!
I am--(<i>He is about to offer his hand to </i><span class="sc2">Kurt</span>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Stepping between</i>) You don't shake hands with this man.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Looks about confused, stares at </i><span class="sc2">Kurt</span>, <i>then at </i><span class="sc2">Trast</span>, <i>
then
at </i><span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>again, gives a little cry, then controls himself</i>) I should
like to have a word with you--Herr Muhlingk--in private.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. As you see, I have some guests here now, but in an hour I shall
be at your service.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. In an hour, Herr Muhlingk!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) He found out quickly enough!</p>

<h2>ACT III.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p class="hang1">Scene:--<i>The same as in Act I. A lamp is burning on the
table. Daylight
is coming through the window. Up-stage to the left is a bed, turned
down. It has not been slept in</i>. <span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>sits at the table his face in
his hands</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="center">(<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Frau Heinecke </span><i>in night-cap and wearing a

<br>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Good-morning, my son! (<i>He does not answer</i>) Poor
thing!
he ain't even been to bed! (<i>Goes to him, wiping her eyes</i>) Bobby!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Starts up</i>) What is it? What do you want?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Lord, how you yell at me! And your teeth are chattering
with cold! Won't you drink some coffee? (<i>He shakes his head
decisively</i>) Take a little piece of advice from your old mother, Bobby;
even if a person is in trouble, he's got to sleep. Sleep puts marrow in
the bones. (<i>Puts out the lamp</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Mother, Mother, what have you done?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Crying</i>) We aren't to blame, my boy!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Not to blame!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. I brought her up honorably. There has never been a bad
example in this house. I kept her at her schooling and I had her
confirmed, though that ain't even necessary any more. She went up to
the altar in a new black pleated dress. I bought it myself at a
bargain, and I put my own wedding handkerchief into her hand, and the
preacher spoke so movin', so movin'.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. But how could you allow her to have anything to do with
that--fellow!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Perhaps it wasn't really so bad----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What further proof do you want? Didn't he admit everything to
me with the most brutal frankness? Or did Alma try to lie about it? And
to cap the climax, last evening I was in Michalski's house. Everything
was beautifully arranged. Your dear daughter Auguste had prepared a
secret nest, with curtains and carpets and red hanging lamps. She kept
watch at the door herself and was--paid, paid for it! The cur was in my
hands yesterday. If I had only finished him then!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Why, Robert----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Be still! He promised satisfaction. I accomplished that much at
least. He saw I was ready for anything. He said he would find means of
giving me satisfaction by to-day. I thought of the poor little girl's
future and let him go.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Well, I never suspected anything wrong.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You must have seen it coming. What did you think when he
brought her home so late at night?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. When a person is asleep, he's glad enough he don't have
to think. Besides, she had a latchkey.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. But you couldn't neglect the fact that if he brought her home
he must have met her somewhere in the city.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Well, yes. I thought she was going with him.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. She was <i>going</i> with him.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. So you said, but I----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Just like any young girl goes with a young gentleman.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Goes? Where?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. To concerts, to restaurants--If he's got money, to the
theater, and in summer to Grunewald<a name="div2Ref_07" href="#div2_07">[7]</a> or Treptow.<a name="div2Ref_08" href="#div2_08">[8]</a></p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Alone?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Alone? (<i>Clacks her tongue</i>) No! With the young man!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I meant: without her parents?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Certainly. Or do you expect the old mother is going to
toddle after the young ones on her weak legs.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Mm! So you knew she &quot;went&quot; with him?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. No, I just thought so.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And when you asked her?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Why should I ask? That would only be wasting breath. A
girl ought to know herself what's good for her.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Oh!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. But that she--oh, who'd have thought it! Lord, how you
tremble. I must get this room warm for you. (<i>Goes to stove</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) No way out! No way to save things! Shame!--a
life of shame!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Into the kitchen</i>) Father, bring in some coke!
(<i>Kneels and shakes down the fire</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) What sort of satisfaction can he have meant?
Marriage? (<i>He laughs</i>) And if it came to that, I'm not sure whether I
should want marriage for her. At least there is the chance of a duel.
If he shoots me down, then I'm saved. But--what will become of these?

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Good-morning, Father.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Muttering</i>) Yes, yes----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Quit grumbling, Father. Help me make a fire.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) And if I kill him? I'll admit that would be a
relief! But the question remains: what will become of them? (<i>Looking
toward his parents</i>) I'm afraid that I can't afford the luxury of a
sense of honor. (<i>Crying out</i>) Oh, how vile I am!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Something wrong, my boy?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. It's because of Alma. He hasn't even been to bed.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Yes, Alma! That's what a man grows gray in honor for. But I
always said it: the Avenue'll bring us trouble some day.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Heinecke</span>) Father, don't cry! (<i>They embrace</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) But someone's heart must break!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Oh, I'm not crying! I'm master of this house! I know what
I've got to do! Poor cripple has his honor, too. Think I'll stand for
it! My daughter! She'll see! (<i>Swinging the poker</i>) I'll give her my
curse! My paternal curse!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Arranging the bed</i>) Now, now, now----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Yes, you! You don't understand anything about honor.
(<i>Strikes his breast</i>) There lies honor! Out into the streets she'll
go! Out into the night and the storm!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Do you want her to be absolutely ruined?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Let him talk, he don't mean anything.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Won't you see where she is? I suppose she's ashamed to show
herself.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. She wanted to sleep.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Oh!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>She goes to the bed-room door</i>) Alma! (<i>No answer</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Oh, she never should have been left alone.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Opens the door</i>) Just as I said, she's asleep.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. She can sleep!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Will you get up, you worthless girl?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Come, get up, or there'll be trouble.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Father, Mother, quick, before she comes! Don't be too hard with
her. It will only make her more stubborn.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. You are a good deal more clever than your old mother,
but just the same I know how to take care of my children. I'll keep her
like in a reform-school if it breaks my heart:--cleaning boots, peeling
potatoes, cleaning floors, scrubbing steps, she's got to do it all.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And suppose she runs away some night?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Pah, she'll be locked up. I'll have the key in my pocket.
How'll she run away then?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. But think, she is only a child! And the rest are more to blame
than she. Her own sister--Ah, if you want to be severe you ought to be
severe with that damned procuress!--I hope I can demand once for all
that Alma be taken absolutely away from under the influence of her
sister and that you'll show Auguste and her husband the door!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Certainly, we'll make a clean sweep of that outfit. I've had
enough of Michalski. Now you see. Mother, Robert has to come all the
way from India to say it! You haven't any respect for me, poor old man!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I beg your pardon. Father--this doesn't concern you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Just the same----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Her apron over her face</i>) But she is my child, too!
And I love all my children the same!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Even if they aren't worthy of your love?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Then all the more.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Shh!</p>
<br>
<p class="hang3">(<span class="sc2">Alma </span><i>appears in the bed-room door dressed in a nightgown and a while

<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Hoho!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Wringing her hands</i>) Child! child, is this our reward?
Haven't I done everything in the world for you? Haven't I kept you like
a princess? But now it's over. What are you standing there for? Get a
broom! Sweep the room!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Well, are you going to begin?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Ceremoniously</i>) Alma, my daughter, come here--close!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Please, please, don't strike me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. That is the least I'll do! I'm an honest old man! Yes, here
lies honor! Do you know what I'm going to do with you now? I'm going to
curse you! What do you say to that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Go away--let me alone.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. You defy me, do you?--you don't know me yet! you!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Father, be still! she's got to work.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. What! I can't be allowed to curse my own disobedient child.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, that only happens in books!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Hey?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. My dear parents! You mustn't go on like this! Please leave me
alone with her a moment. Meanwhile, dress. I daresay there will be
visitors.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And I'm not allowed to curse my--Hmm, wait!</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Frau Heinecke </span><i>pulls him out of the room.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>To himself</i>) Now I'll see what she really thinks, and what I
have to do! (<i>Softly</i>) Come here, sister.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Mother said I had to clean the room.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That can wait! (<i>Takes her hand</i>) You don't need to be afraid I
won't strike you! And I won't curse you, either. You may be sure you
have one good friend who is willing to keep watch over you--a true and
considerate friend.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. You are too good--Much too good! (<i>She sinks down before him
weeping</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. There, there--get up! Sit on the footstool!--There--(<i>She sits
on the stool</i>) and straighten up, so I can see your eyes. (<i>Tries to
lift her head, but she hides it in her lap</i>) You won't! Well, cry then!
I won't send you away from here--and you will cry for many a day and
many a night when you really understand what you have done! Tell me,
you realize, don't you, that all the rest of your life must be
repentance?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Yes, I know.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Takes her head in his hands</i>) Yes, yes, sister, and this is
what a man works ten years in a foreign country to build up a fortune
for--Ten long years! and twenty will hardly be enough to make us forget
this disgrace----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. In twenty years I'll be old.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Old?--What difference does that make? For us two there is no
more youth.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Oh, God!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Springing up in excitement</i>) Don't be afraid, we'll stay
together! We'll find some hiding place; like hunted animals! Yes,
that's what we are! We've been hunted and mangled! (<span class="sc2">Alma </span><i>sinks down,
her face in the empty chair</i>) Only we two can heal each other's wounds!
You mine, and I yours. (<i>To himself</i>) Oh, how she lies there! God in
Heaven, there is only one thing to do!--the pure little child-soul he
has trampled into the dirt, he can never give back--other satisfaction
I don't need!--Alma!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. (<i>Sitting up</i>) What?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You really love him?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Whom?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Whom? Him!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And if you lost him entirely, would you feel that you could not
bear it at all?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Oh no!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Good!--You are a brave little girl!--One can learn to
forget!--One can learn--(<i>He sits down</i>) Above all, you must work! The
singing nonsense is over, of course! You have learned dressmaking, you
can begin that again! But you mustn't go back into a shop. There are
too many temptations and bad examples there!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Yes, yes, the girls are bad.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Let him among you who is without sin--you know! And least of
all, you! Where we shall go I can't say as yet. I couldn't think of
uprooting our old parents; otherwise I should take them along. It
doesn't matter where--only a long, long way, where you will belong only
to me and your work--For you can take my word for it all--tired is
half-happy!--Mother and Father would live with us, and you shall help
me to take care of them. Besides your dressmaking, you'll have to wash
and cook. Will you do that and be patient with Father and Mother?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. If you want me to.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. No, you must want to with a good will, otherwise it is useless.
I ask you again, will you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Yes, from to-morrow on, I'll do everything.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That's right--but why from to-morrow and not from to-day?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Because to-day I was----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Well, well?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Oh, please----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Kindly</i>) Out with it!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. I wanted--to--go--so bad--to the masked ball! (<i>There is a long
pause</i>, Robert <i>gets up and paces the room</i>) May I?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. May I?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Call father and mother.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Why not? (<i>Whining</i>) Just once! Can't a person have just one good
time, if it's to be the last of everything.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Do you know what you're saying?--You----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. (<i>Arrogantly</i>) Yes, I do know what I'm saying! I'm not such a
little fool! I know a few things about life myself--What are you so
excited about, anyway? Isn't it a pretty hard lot when a person has to
sit here for nothing? The sun never shines in an old hole like this,
nor the moon either, and all you hear on every side is jabbering and
scolding!--and nobody with any decent manners. Father scolds, and
mother scolds--and you sew your fingers bloody!--and you get fifty
pfennigs a day and that don't even pay for the kerosene!--and when you
are young and pretty--and you want to have a good time and go in decent
society a little--I was always in favor of something higher--I always
liked to read about it in the stories. And as for getting married? Who
should I marry, then? Such plebeians as those that work down there in
the factory don't interest me! No siree! All they can do is drink up
their pay and come home and beat you!--I want a gentleman and if I
can't have one I don't want anybody! And Kurt has always treated me
decently--I never learned any dirty words from him, I'll tell you--I've
picked them up right here at home! And I'm not going to stay here,
either! And I don't need you to take care of me, either! Girls like me
don't starve to death!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Starts to speak then stops</i>) Call Father and mother!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. And now I'm going to ask father if I--(<i>As he threatens her</i>)

Yes, yes, I'm going! (<i>She goes out</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. So that is the way it stands?--That's my sister! Ah, what a
weak fool I was!--Began to sugar this indecency with poetry and
sorrow!--That wasn't seduction--it was in the blood!--Well, I must act,
now! Rough if need be, otherwise everything is lost.</p>

a great change in your life.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. What's the matter?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I am certain that Alma will be absolutely ruined if she is not
brought into surroundings that make it impossible for her to return to
her previous life.--But what will become of you? You can't stay here,
if you did, you would soon be a prey to the Michalskis. So the long and
short of it is--you must come with me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Frightened</i>) To India?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. It makes no difference where. Perhaps even as far as India.
Trast's influence reaches a long way. We are in a position to choose.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Defiantly</i>) Oh yes, choose India!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. I don't know which end I'm on!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. It will be hard for you! I realize that. But don't worry; it's
not as bad as it seems. You can live a thousand times more comfortably
in the tropics than here. You can have as many servants as you like!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Thousands!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And your own house!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And palms?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. More than you can use.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And you can pick the fruit right off the trees.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. It picks itself.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And it costs nothing.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Almost nothing.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And the parrots fly around--and the apes? Like out at the
zoo?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. So you will come?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. What do you think. Father?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Well--'s far's I'm concerned, we'll come.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. What for?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Just because Alma wanted to go to a masked ball.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. Crazy!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. The few pieces of furniture that made the home so

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Sentimentally</i>) And poor me, are you going to leave me,

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. The furniture? (<span class="sc2">Auguste </span><i>nods</i>) We'll have to.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Really! I'm glad to hear it! But that is not what brought me
here, good people; you have a daughter.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Advancing</i>) At your service!</p>

<p class="normal">Muhlingk, What can I do for you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Deferentially</i>) I am the daughter.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Ah! very good, very good. But I was not referring to you. The
girl's name is Alma.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. That's it. And a mighty pretty girl, if I do say it
myself.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Ah! it is always pleasing to see children who make their
parents happy. But there is one thing that I don't like--your daughter
has taken advantage of the fact that I have allowed you to occupy my
house, and has established illicit relations with my son. Frankly, I
expected a little more gratitude.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, Herr Councillor!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. In order to sever all connection whatsoever between your
house and mine, I offer you a cash compensation--which you, my dear
Heinecke, and your daughter Alma, may divide, with the understanding
that half will go to her as a dowry, as soon as she finds someone
who--(<i>Laughs discreetly</i>) Well, you understand! Until then, the entire
sum will be at your disposal. Do you agree?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Behind </i><span class="sc2">Heinecke</span>) Say yes!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. I--I----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. I have offered an unusually large amount in order to free
myself of a promise extracted yesterday by your son from my son.--It
amounts to--a--fifty thousand marks.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>With an exclamation</i>) God! Herr Councillor, are you in
earnest?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. I'm getting dizzy! (<i>Sinks into a chair</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) I made it too high!--I put the question again, will
you be satisfied with forty thousand marks?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Nudging her father</i>) Say yes, quick--or he'll come down
again.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. I can't believe it, Herr Councillor! Even the forty--There
isn't that much money--It's nonsense--show me the money.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. It is at the office, waiting for you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And the cashier won't say: Put the fellow out--he's
drunk!--Oh, he can be right sharp with the poor people when he wants
to--that cashier! (<span class="sc2">Muhlingk </span><i>draws out a check and fills it; hands it
to </i><span class="sc2">Heinecke</span>: <i>they all study the writing</i>) Forty thousand marks!
Always the generous gentleman, Herr Councillor. Give me your hand!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. (<i>Putting his hand in his pocket</i>) One thing more: to-morrow
evening a moving van will be in front of your door; within two hours
you will be good enough to leave my property,--and I hope that will be
the last I hear of you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Don't say that, Herr Councillor! If the visit of an honest
old man isn't disagreeable to you, I'll take the liberty of calling now
and then. Yes, I'm an honest old man!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Certainly! Good-day, my good people! (<i>Aside</i>) Pah! (<i>He goes
out</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Mother! Forty thousand! (<span class="sc2">Michalski </span><i>tries to embrace him</i>)

Three paces to the rear, my son! (<i>Takes out an old handkerchief and
carefully does up the check in it, then puts it in breast pocket</i>) Now
you can be as tender as you like.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. I'm half sick with joy! (<i>The two embrace and weep</i>)

When I think! I don't need to go to market without money any more. And
when I'm cold in the afternoons, I can make a fire without having a bad
conscience--a good fire--and in the evening cold meat!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And in the evening I can take the horse-car whenever I want!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. Exactly four hundred thousand times, at ten pfennigs per!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. And you'll buy me a sofa.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. Now you won't be going to India.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. For the Lord's sake.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Are you crazy?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. And what will Herr Robert have to say to that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Happily</i>) Yes--Robert! (<i>Goes to bedroom door</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Holding her back</i>) I advise you to let him sleep. He'll hear
about it soon enough.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Startled</i>) What d'you mean by that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Pulling at </i><span class="sc2">Frau Heinecke's </span><i>dress and pointing to kitchen
door</i>) He! he! Her! In there!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, the poor, dear child!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Mysteriously</i>) Well give her a little surprise!--Shh! (<i>All
tiptoe to the kitchen door</i>--<span class="sc2">Heinecke</span>, <i>who is leading the way, opens
the door suddenly, then with a cry, starts back</i>) Wha--wh--Mother!
What's that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Looking over their shoulders</i>) The devil!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>With pretended severity</i>) You come here!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. (<i>Outside</i>) Oh, please--no!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Are you coming?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. From the stark-naked princess!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. I--just--wanted--to try it on! I'll take it right off!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Ach! what a little angel!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. Aren't you angry with me any more?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Angry! (<i>Then recalling his severity</i>) That is--yes--very.
But for once we'll allow mercy to take the place of justice. (<i>Turning
around</i>) That was pretty good, eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Strokes </i><span class="sc2">Alma's </span><i>hair and leads her toward the left</i>)

Come, sit down. No, here on the arm-chair!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. What is it--what's happened?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. And I can go to the masked ball?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. (<i>Ironically</i>) The poor child!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Jumping up</i>) I must go this minute to the bank!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Opening bottle of liqueur</i>) Wait! We'll wet up our luck so
it'll stick! Alma, some glasses.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Getting up</i>) Let the poor child sit still! I'll 'tend
to that myself! (<i>She goes to the washstand and brings a set of liqueur
glasses. To </i><span class="sc2">Auguste</span>) What did you mean before about Robert?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. You'll see quick enough.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. He won't grudge us old folks a little good luck, will
he?</p>

<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. Morning, brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Will you kindly explain, Mother, how these two happen to be
sitting at the table of respectable people?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. Oh!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Don't be so inhospitable!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Going toward him</i>) Bobby, you mustn't be proud,
specially to your own flesh and blood.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Hm--Alma, what is that? Who gave you permission----?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. And you may as well know now as any time, there's no use
having any hopes about India. I prefer to spend my money in Germany.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Confused</i>) What has happened?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. You tell him, Father, you're the one that got the check!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What check?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Assuming a pose</i>) My son!--one doesn't often seem what one
really is--Such things are deeper--For that reason one must always be
respectful--you can never tell what is hidden under tattered clothes.
Anyone can wear a fur-lined coat.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Will you please explain what---
Heinecke. Explain?--What is there to explain--Don't look at me like
that! What are you looking at me that way for. Mother, I won't stand
it!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Go on! Go on!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Well, as I said, it's simple enough. The Herr Councillor was
here.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. He? Why didn't you call me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Ah--In the first place because it was not the young
Muhlingk--When <i>your</i> friend comes, then you can receive him. The old
gentleman is my friend--We've promised to call on each other. And
second: because I don't have to ask my son what is right for me to
do--Now you know--See?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Oh, Father!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Don't interrupt me when I'm giving my son a little
admonition. From now on I'm not going to be fooled with.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Behind him</i>) That's the way to talk.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Was the discussion about Alma?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. In the first place the discussion was about you. You have
been discharged from his service, because of insubordination. Frankly,
I expected more gratitude.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Sternly</i>) Yes, me! Your honest old father!--It isn't
pleasant for me to have my son wander around as a clerk out of a job.
Now you've got till four to settle your accounts or it will go hard
with you.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>About to break out--controls himself</i>) Let's talk about Alma!
Did he offer satisfaction?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Certainly, absolute.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Hesitating, as if saying something foolish</i>) Ah--marriage?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. What marriage?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. With his son----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. You must be crazy.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Anxiously</i>) Well, what else?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Slyly in his ear</i>) Forty thousand marks! (<i>Aloud</i>) Fine,
eh?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>With a cry</i>) Money!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Frightened</i>) Lord! I thought so!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Yes, sir! Here it is, good as gold!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What! you took it?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. (<i>Wonderingly</i>) Well?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. He offered you money and you took it! (<i>Against his will he
springs toward his father</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Stepping between them</i>) I advise you to leave the old man
alone!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Reeling back without noticing him</i>) Mother, you took it!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Folding her hands</i>) We're poor folks, my boy! (<span class="sc2">Robert </span>

wrong with him! (<i>Puts her hand on his shoulder</i>) My Boy, take a little
advice from your poor old mother. Don't step on your good fortune's
toes, for pride dies on the straw.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Straw wouldn't be the worst. Mother--I shall die on the grave's
edge, or in the gutter like a street cur! Only do give the money
back--(<i>Desperately</i>) See, I am talking perfectly calmly, perfectly
sensibly, I'll show you as plain as day what you must do. That fellow
has brought us into disgrace--But we are innocent--We needn't be
ashamed before anyone. A man can steal honor just the same as he can
steal a purse. No one can prevent that!--But if we let someone buy our
honor with cold money, then we have no honor at all--and it serves us
right--(<span class="sc2">Heinecke </span><i>turns to </i><span class="sc2">Michalski</span>, <i>touching his forehead</i>) Heaven
knows I understand it all! I'm not critcizing--Really I'm not.--You are
poor and you've always been poor. Such a miserable existence! Nothing
but worry for daily bread destroys all judgment and all dignity. And
now you let yourselves be blinded by a little money!--but believe me,
it will never give you pleasure. Nothing will be left but disgust!
(<i>Choking</i>) Ah, the disgust! It chokes----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. That kind of talk is enough to turn you cold----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. So <i>that</i> is my son!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And don't imagine that you will lose by taking my advice. Look
at me! I have learned a few things, haven't I? I'm healthy, I can be
trusted, can't I--The few remaining years you can trust to me, can't
you?--Can't you see. I want nothing better than to work for you--I'll
make you rich! Rich! you can do what you like with me! I'll be your
slave! Your pack-horse--Only give back that money!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. That's all very well! But a bird in the hand--Let me tell
you!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. You're right there, Father!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. I certainly am right!--You run along and chase your sparrows,
my boy. I'll keep the bird I've got.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. Bravo!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And you, Mother?--(<i>She turns away</i>) You too?--God, what have I
left?--Alma, what about you? I offer you everything. Only help me! (<i>He
takes her hand. She struggles a little. He draws her toward the
center</i>) You've given yourself away. Well, perhaps that's your right.
But you won't <i>sell</i> yourself--you can't sell your love in the public
market. Alma, tell them that!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. (<i>Angrily</i>) Let me go!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. He's breaking the kid's arm.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. You've got nothing to say to me any more. (<i>She breaks away</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Little sister!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Alma</span>. And I'm going to the masked ball, too! Ask mother if I ain't.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Mother!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Why shouldn't the poor child have a little fun once in a
while?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Overcome</i>) So we've gone that far?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Sitting in chair, mockingly</i>) Yes, we've gone that far!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You--<i>Procuror</i>! Get out of that chair! (<span class="sc2">Michalski </span><i>remains
seated</i>, <span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>takes hold of the back of the chair</i>) Get up, I say,
and get out of here, both of you!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Michalski</span>. (<i>Threateningly</i>) Now that's a little too fresh!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Who has seized the chair</i>) Dare to lay a hand on me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Throwing herself between them</i>) You'll break my
arm-chair.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I suppose that comes from our friends on the Avenue whom you
hold in such high esteem!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Of course it does!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. From our dear Herr Kurt, I suppose?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. Well, yes!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>With a wild laugh</i>) There it is, then! (<i>He throws the chair
to the floor, breaking it and kicking the pieces away from him</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Heinecke</span>. (<i>Weeping</i>) My beautiful arm-chair! (<i>She picks up the
pieces carrying them to the left--then she sinks down on stool</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. This is getting uncomfortable! (<i>He starts to go out, right</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Standing in his way</i>) Will you give that blood-money back?
Yes or no?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Heinecke</span>. Give it back? (<i>Contemptuously</i>) Huh!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Then I'm through with you! and you, too, Mother. Is a man
brought into the world for that! To wear dishonor like a birthmark?
Very good! If I had to be born, why didn't you leave me in the dirt
when I first saw the day? Where I've got to wallow for the rest of my
life because my worthy family desires it!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Auguste</span>. Do you hear that, Mother, and he was always your favorite.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. No, no, Mother, don't listen to me! (<i>Kneeling beside her</i>) I
said nothing! If I said anything, it was only madness. To-day I feel as
though I were cut loose from everything that is human--or natural!
Mother, have pity on me! You can save me! Come with me!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc2">Scene</span>:--<i>Same as in Act II</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Trast</span>, <span class="sc2">Wilhelm </span><i>and </i><span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>discovered</i>. <span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>

<br>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. (<i>Aside to </i><span class="sc2">Trast</span>) I have strict orders not to let Herr
Heinecke in.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Nor me?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. Oh, with the Count it is a different matter.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Thank you for the trust you put in me. Herr Heinecke is
accompanied by me. I shall be responsible for his presence here. We
shall wait for the Herr Councillor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. But----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Which do you prefer--specie or paper? (<i>Looking for money in his
pocket-book</i>) Is the whole house empty?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. The Herr Councillor has gone to the factory, the Gnadige Frau
has a headache, the Gnadiges Fraulein has gone to the city--Herr Kurt
likewise.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Together?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. Oh, they never go together--Herr Kurt wanted to countermand
the invitation--because--(<i>Indicates </i><span class="sc2">Robert</span>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Gives him money</i>) Good! That's all!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. Nothing further, sir?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Go.</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Wilhelm </span><i>bows and goes out</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Come here, my boy.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What do you want?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. What do I want? You know I never want anything. These things
don't affect me. But the question is: What do you want here--in this
house?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I want to settle my account.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Of course--we know that--But, inasmuch as you are willing to
forego the generous handshake that the workman usually gets at this
proud moment, I should think you would send the accounts to the
office--and--(<i>With gesture of finality</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That would be simple enough.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. My dear man, let me talk to you as a friend!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Go ahead, talk!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. You are pursuing a phantom!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Really?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. No one has touched your honor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Really!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Because nobody in the world could do it.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Really, really!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. This thing that you call honor--this mixture of shame, and
&quot;tempo,&quot; and--honesty and pride, things you have acquired through a
civilized existence and as a result of your own loyalty, why this can
no more be taken away from you by a piece of treachery than your
generosity or your judgment! Either it is a part of yourself or else it
doesn't exist at all. The sort of honor that can be destroyed by a blow
from a fop's glove has nothing to do with you! That is nothing but a
mirror for the dandies, a plaything for the indolent and a perfume to
the boulevardier.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You talk like someone trying to make a virtue out of necessity.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Perhaps--because every virtue is a direct result of necessity.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And my family?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. I didn't think you had a family now! (<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>buries his face in
his hands</i>) I understand--it's a contraction of the nerves after the
limb is amputated.--Don't deceive yourself! Even though the foot still
pains you, the leg is gone!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. You never had a sister!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>.--Tell me, must I, the aristocrat, learn what abasement means
from you, a plebeian? My boy, don't forswear your parents. Don't say
that they are worse than you or I.--They are different, that's all.
Their sensations are sensations that are strange to you, the point of
view they hold is simply beyond your comprehension. Therefore to
criticize them is not only narrow-minded, but presumptuous--And you may
as well know soon as late: in your struggle with your people you have
been wrong from beginning to end!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Trast, you say that!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. I take the liberty--You come back from a foreign country where
you have been associating with triple-plated gentlemen, and then you
expect your people, in order to please you, to change the very skins
they live in; although they've fitted perfectly all these years! That
is immodest, my boy! And your sister has really received back her honor
from the family Muhlingk; the honor which she can make use of. For
everything on this earth has its price and value. The honor of the
Avenue may be paid for with blood--may be, I said. The honor of the
Alley is restituted with a little capital, <i>in integrum</i>. (<i>As </i><span class="sc">Robert </span>
<i>steps towards him angrily</i>) Don't eat me up! I haven't finished!
Yes--what other significance has a girl's honor--and that's what we're
concerned with now--than to bring a sort of dowry of pure-heartedness
and honesty to her husband. She is there for one purpose and that is
marriage! Just be so good as to make a few inquiries in the society
from which you come and see if your sister, with the money that has
dropped into her lap, can't make a much better match than she otherwise
could!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Trast, you are cruel, you are crude!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Crude like Nature, cruel like Truth! Only the indolent and the
cowardly surround themselves a <i>tout prix</i> with idyllics--But you have
nothing to do with them now. Come, give me your hand, shake the dust of
home off your feet and don't look back!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. First I must have personal satisfaction.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. So you insist on fighting a duel with him?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Don't be so old-fashioned.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Old-fashioned--I may be. Perhaps because I came into the world
as a plebeian and because my conception of honor was acquired. I
haven't the strength to rise to the heights of your standpoint. Let me
go down in my own narrowness if I must.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. But suppose he won't give satisfaction?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I shall find some way to force him.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Aha! (<i>Aside</i>) the revolver!--One thing more, my boy; if you
have made up your mind to let Herr Kurt put a bullet through you, you
must take away every pretext for his refusing.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Heavens, yes! you are right!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Drawing out his pocket-book</i>) Does that embarrass you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. No, you have done too much for me, for me to ask----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Filling out a check</i>) There!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. And if I can never pay that back?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Then I'll write it in the largest ledger, where the accounts of
friendships are kept (<i>Stroking his head</i>) It won't be as bad as that!
Hm--my boy--one thing you've forgotten.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. What?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Leonore.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Shuddering</i>) Don't speak of her!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. You love her.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Oh!--I shan't answer!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Would you like to have her think of you as the murderer of her
brother.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Better than if she had to think of me as a man without honor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Straightening up</i>) Am I not a so-called &quot;man without honor?&quot;
And haven't you found me a good fellow? And don't I carry my head as
high as anyone in the world? Shame on you!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>After a pause</i>) Trast--forgive me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Forgive--Nonsense, I like you!--That's enough!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Trast--I--won't fight--the duel!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Your word?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. My word!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Come, then.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Where?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. How do I know? Into the world.</p>

about to follow him, but stops</i>) --Perhaps it was imprudent after
all?--But if the youngster comes home, I'll keep them apart. Now there
is something else to attend to. If this girl here is what I think she
is--(<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Leonore L. </span><i>wearing a winter costume</i>) Ah, this is very
fortunate.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Giving him her hand. Excitedly</i>) Count, do you know where
I've been? To your apartment! (<i>Takes her coat and hat off</i>) Are you
shocked at my boldness? But you were the only one to whom I could go to
find out what has happened. I was afraid my brother was on the way to
ruin that young girl. I suspected it. Has your friend found out?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. If that were all!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. What else could there be----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. I admit, I really can't find words to----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Please tell me!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Very well! Your parents have considered it necessary to make
those poor people forget their trouble--so they appealed to them on
their weakest side--namely, by their poverty.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Do you mean to say that?--that--they--bought my
brother's--(<i>As </i><span class="sc2">Trast </span><i>nods</i>) Oh, God!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. It goes without saying that personally I offer no criticism of
them whatever. That is the customary means of ending such
relationships. But I am afraid for my friend.</p>

practice of my home!--Pay!--always pay! pay for honor, pay for love,
pay for justice! We can afford it, we have the money. (<i>Throws herself
into a chair. Then springing up</i>) Forgive me! I don't know what I'm
doing! I spoke of my family as though they were strangers.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Perhaps they are more strangers to you than you think!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Confused</i>) If you were only right! (<i>As he appears to listen
to something outside</i>) What is it?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. Isn't that your brother's voice?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>At the door</i>) Yes, with some of his friends.</p>

further, Herr Muhlingk. My friend at this moment is with your father,

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. That is also his privilege. Count.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. In an hour my friend will have left this establishment. In
consideration of the strain of excitement under which he is probably
suffering at present, it would be to the advantage of both sides if a
meeting between you could be avoided.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Merrily</i>) Ah, yes!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Lothar</span>. Will you be kind enough to recall, that the Count von
Trast-Saarberg, as we can still see in the register,--on the
twenty-fifth of June, 1864, was released, under a cloud, from his
regiment, because of unpaid gambling debts. That is all. (<i>Bows
negligently</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Breaking out into laughter</i>) Gentlemen, I thank you heartily
for the little lesson--I certainly deserved it--for the worst crime
under heaven is to be illogical! And one thing I see above everything
else. No matter how much a man is elevated above the modern Honor he
must still remain her slave, even if it is only when he wants to help a
poor devil of a friend out of a hole--Gentlemen, I have the honor--
Pardon! I <i>haven't</i> the honor! You have denied me that; so nothing
remains but the pleasure--the pleasure of saying &quot;Good-day,&quot; but that
is better still! (<i>He goes out laughing</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. No, Father. I can't play the part of the silent daughter any
longer. If I am a member of the family I want to take part in this
conversation.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. What is the meaning of all this ceremony?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Something very unfortunate has taken place in our family.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. I don't know anything----!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. You needn't try to hide it from me. According to the rules of
modern hypocrisy which are applied to the so-called young ladies, I
ought to go about with downcast eyes and play the part of innocent
ignorance. Under the circumstances that doesn't work. I have heard
about the whole affair.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. And you aren't ashamed of yourself?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Bitterly</i>) I am ashamed of myself.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Do you know whom you are speaking to? Are you mad?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. If my tone was impertinent, please forgive me. I want to
soften you, not to quarrel with you. Perhaps I have been a bad
daughter--Perhaps I really haven't the right to have my own thoughts as
long as I do not eat my own bread--If that is true, try to pardon me--I
will make up for it a thousand times. But understand--give him back his
honor----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. I won't ask you again what the fellow is to you?--what do you
mean by &quot;giving him back his honor?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Heavens, you must first at least have the good will to make up
for what has happened. Then we can find the means later.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. You think so? Sit down, my child--I shall let my customary
mildness still govern me and try to bring you to reason, although
perhaps a stricter method would be more in place--Look at this old gray
head. A great deal of honor has been piled up there and still in my
whole life I have never meddled with this so-called sense of honor--ah,
what a person has to endure without even saying &quot;Hum&quot; when he expects
to succeed in life. Here is a young man from whom you say, I have taken
his honor. Taking for granted that you are right--where does a young
fellow like that get his honor? From his family? Or from my business?
My clerks are no knights. You say he had honor, and I'm supposed to
give it back to him. How? By taking his sister as a daughter-in-law?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. Really, Theodore, you mustn't say these things even as a
joke.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. If I did that, I should disgrace myself and my family. On the
other hand, this young man has the chance of getting out of the
trouble. If he refuses, and it comes back to me, who shall be made
unhappy, we or he? My answer is; he shall, I have no desire to be,
myself--That's the way I've always done, and everyone knows me as a man
of honor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Rising</i>) Father, is that your last word?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. My last! Now, come, give me a kiss and beg your mother's
pardon.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Shrinks back with a shudder</i>) Let me go! I can't deceive
you!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Father, I feel I am in the wrong, that I am asking the
impossible from you. I shall have to know the world differently
from--(<i>Stops suddenly and listens. There are voices in the hall</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. And----?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) It's he!--Oh, I can't stand it any longer!</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Wilhelm</span>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. The young Herr Heinecke from the Alley is there again.</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>starts.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Did you tell him what I told you to say?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>. Yes, Herr Councillor, but he followed me here from the office.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. What impertinence!--If he doesn't leave this----!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Pardon me. Father. Perhaps he only wants to thank you! I believe
he has reasons.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Such people never give you thanks.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Has he money to give you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. There must be something back of it--get it over and we'll be done
with him.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. As far as I'm concerned--let him come.</p>
<br>
<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Wilhelm </span><i>goes out.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. We'll go, Leonore,</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Aside</i>) Kurt!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Well?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Be on your guard!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Bah! (<i>Trying to hide his fear</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="hang3">(<span class="sc2">Frau Muhlingk </span><i>and </i><span class="sc2">Leonore </span><i>go out. Enter </i><span class="sc2">Robert</span>, <i>apparently
calm,
respectful in manner--he carries a portfolio.</i>)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. You were a little insistant, young man--Well, I never
criticize a man in the discharge of duty; least of all when he is about
to leave his employer, at the eleventh hour. Take a seat!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. If you don't mind, I'll remain standing.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Just as you like--I had word from my nephew yesterday. He is
getting on well--having a good time--a little too much according to
Count Trast--Well, a little pleasure is always in the blood of
gentlemen of good family--You have brought the annual report with you,
I hope?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. And----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Muhlingk</span>) There, sir, (<i>Takes a sheet and hands it to
the </i><span class="sc2">Councillor</span>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. (<i>Playing the part of indifference</i>) May I see, Father?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Yes, yes--or perhaps you have a copy?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Please give it to my son. (<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>hands it to </i><span class="sc2">Kurt</span>. <i>The
two stand, measuring each other with their eyes</i>) As far as I can see
at the first glance that is exceedingly good. The net gain is----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. 116,227 Gulden.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. The dutch gulden is one mark seventy--Kurt figure it with me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. 197,585 Marks.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. 8--1--3--5--8. Right--197,285 Marks and 90 Pfennigs. Kurt,
are you figuring it up?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. And ninety pfennig. Yes, Father.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Ha--And in the coffee &quot;a small profit?&quot; What does that mean?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Handing him a sheet</i>) Here is the special account. I was in a
position to foresee the crisis caused by the competition in Brazil and
I had five-sixths of the area planted with tea.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. You?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Yes, Herr Councillor, I----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Strange!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. And how is the &quot;Quinquina?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Here is the report. (<i>Hands him the paper</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Not much, either! Where does the profit come in that brings
up the average?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. The chief source of gain was Sumatra tobacco and the
tea--especially the tea. (<i>Handing another sheet</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. You made this trial on the strength of your own judgment,
too?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Not entirely, I followed a suggestion that my friend, Count
Trast, gave me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. And my nephew approved of it?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Afterwards--yes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. You are right, Kurt--it is strange!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Have the gentlemen any further questions?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Judging from the manner in which you behave here, one might
think that you had been running my business in Java yourself. What do
you imply by that?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That I had the authority, Herr Councillor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. And where was my nephew, meanwhile?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. That is a question too general to answer, Herr Councillor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Didn't he come to the office every day?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. No, Herr Councillor.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. (<i>With increasing anger</i>) When did he come?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. When the post from Hamburg came, and when he had need of money.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Do you imply by that that my nephew neglected his duty?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I don't wish to imply anything that I have not said.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Then kindly explain to me.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I don't feel myself called upon to discuss the private life of
my former manager.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. But to paint him as black as you can--that suits you better!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Starts forward toward him, but controls himself</i>) Have the
gentlemen any further questions?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. What monies have you brought with you?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. I have notes from different banks amounting to about 95,000
gulden--here they are.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Kurt, check that up. (<span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>rises and takes each paper from </i>
<span class="sc2">Robert </span><i>in turn and looks it through</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Have you finished, Herr Councillor?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Just a minute. (<i>Pause</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Correct.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Well, my dear Herr--Heinecke, I wish you success in your
future enterprises. Be an industrious fellow and don't forget what you
owe to this house.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. No, Herr Councillor, I shan't forget! Here is the forty
thousand marks that you had the kindness to give to my father.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. This forty thousand was a gift, not a loan.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Nevertheless, I consider myself responsible for its return.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Has your father given his authority for the return of the
money?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. No, he has not.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Then the money is your own?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Yes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Hmm!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Kurt</span>. Don't you think it interesting, Father, that Herr Heinecke has
saved so much money?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Thinks a moment, then realizes the meaning of </i><span class="sc2">Kurt's </span>
<i>insinuation, cries out, and steps forward drawing his revolver. He
seizes </i><span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>by the throat</i>) Cur! take that back!--back!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Lets the revolver fall and drops back, his face in his

<br>
<p class="center">(<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Frau Muhlingk</span>.)</p>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. What is it? Kurt? (<i>Rushing to him</i>) Help! Murder!
Murder! Ring, Theodore!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Quiet! There is no further danger! What more do you want? Get
out!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Leave as a thief, eh? (<i>At a movement from </i><span class="sc2">Leonore</span>) Yes,
Leonore, you may as well know I've saved money, I'm a thief!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Father, what is it?--what have you done!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Good. This is a day of reckoning. We might as well settle all
accounts. The account between the Avenue and the Alley. We work for
you. We give you sweat and blood. As a reward you ruin our daughter and
pay for the disgrace with the money we've earned for you. That is what
you call doing a kindness. I have fought tooth and nail for your
business and never asked pay. I have looked up to you as a person looks
up to something holy! You were my faith and my religion! And what did
you do for me? You stole the honor of my house, for it was honorable
even if it was in the Alley. You stole my heart and my people and even
if they were poor beggars, I love them just the same. You stole the
very pillow on which I might rest when I was worn out working for you!
You stole my home and my trust in God and man! You stole my sense of
shame, my peace, my good conscience!--You have stolen the very sun out
of my heaven!--You are the thieves--you!!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. (<i>After a pause</i>) Shall I have the servants put you out?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Stepping between</i>) That you won't do, Father.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. What! You?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. He will leave of his own free will, unmolested, or Father, you
can put me out, too.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Leonore, what are you doing?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Haven't you a word of apology for him?--not a single word?</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. You are mad!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Stop, Leonore! I will think of you with--gratitude--as long
as I live. When I leave you I leave the only thing that I can call
home--God bless you! and farewell! (<i>He goes to door</i>)</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. (<i>Embracing him</i>) Don't go! don't go!--or take me with you!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. Leonore!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. What!!!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Don't leave me alone! My soul is frozen between these walls!
You are my home, too! You have always been! See, I've thrown myself
into your arms!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Oh! what a disgraceful scene!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Father dear, we needn't get angry with each other. I love this
man. For that which you have taken from him I offer that which I have.
(<i>Half to </i><span class="sc2">Robert</span>) I only have myself--If he wants that----</p>

<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. What has happened?</p>

Robert, let us make a new home, new duties.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Robert</span>. (<i>Bitterly, with a look at </i><span class="sc2">Kurt </span><i>who is sitting as though

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Frau Muhlingk</span>. So that is our thanks, Father!</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Leonore</span>. Father, Mother, I ask your forgiveness, but what I am doing
now I must do! I am sure that it can't be wrong. But I beg of you,
think kindly of me--sometimes.</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Muhlingk</span>. Ah, and you think you'll leave my house without my curse!
(<i>He lifts his arm as though to curse her</i>) You----</p>

<p class="normal"><span class="sc">Trast</span>. (<i>Stepping up to him</i>) No, Herr Councillor, what's the use of
wearing yourself out with curses? (<i>Quietly</i>) and furthermore, in
confidence, your daughter isn't making a bad match. The young fellow
will have my station and, since I have no heirs, my fortune.</p>
